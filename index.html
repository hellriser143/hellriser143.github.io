     <h2>   THULASI (potti)  </h2>
	
     <p>
     Celebrating a birthday is special. It’s a day that only comes around once a year, and for this reason it should be a memorable one. It’s a unique day, just for you! The exciting thing is that we can decide how amazing a birthday turns out to be – a good amount of love and effort will result in a happy, successful day. We grow older and wiser as time goes by, giving us the tools and experience to become the person we dream to be. A birthday signifies a fresh start – <strong>a bright and bold </strong>new chapter with new goals and different reasons to be inspired.
